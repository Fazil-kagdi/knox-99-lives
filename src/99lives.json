As a skilled officer, Ferris took an active leadership role in the fighting, performing liaison duty, jumping out of one trench to sprint across the dangerous \"no man's land\" to the next one.  At Saint-Mihiel, the risks Ferris routinely took caught up with him, and he was struck with a gas bomb.  Due to the gassing and prolonged exposure to the cold, he contracted pneumonia and was sent to a hospital at Blois, France.  He died after three days there.",

His distinguished service earned him a rare series of rapid promotions:  to Second Lieutenant on 25 Jul, to First Lieutenant a day later, and then to Captain of the 5th Regiment of the US Marine Corps the day after that.  Holliday served as transportation officer between two brigades of Marines and, in this capacity, participated in the battles of Chateau-Thierry (18 Jul 1918) and Belleau Wood (1-26 Jun 1918), where US casualties were among the highest of the war.  Holliday was a victim of chemical weapons at Belleau Wood and was diagnosed with \"shell shock\" (PTSD).  He returned to fight at Chateau-Thierry, but the trauma of these two battles took their toll on him.  Within weeks, he died of an attack of appendicitis.  His leadership was fondly remembered by his fellow soldiers.",

Word has been received by Vice-President Sisson that Lieutenant Herbert L Miller, formerly of the Publicity Department, has been reported missing in France since September 14.  Letters from the Colonel of his regiment and from the Captain of his company, K, 307th Regiment, advise that in a severe engagement in the Argonne region, Lieutenant Miller and his men were subjected to a withering fire followed by a frontal attack by the Germans which scattered the company and after the fighting was over and the Germans driven back, Lieutenant Miller was not accounted for.  Subsequent search of the region failed to reveal any signs of him, and the officers believe he must have been wounded in the fighting and carried beyond German lines.  Lt Miller was the son of Alderman and Mrs. Charles Miller.</i>",

Heller (ASN:0-442448), United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy while serving with Company E, 60th Infantry Regiment, 9th Infantry Division, in action against enemy forces on 8 November 1942, at Kasba-Mehdia, French Morocco.  Second Lieutenant Heller advanced alone toward the enemy machine gun emplacements with only his sub-machine gun as a weapon.  He disarmed and captured seven prisoners, thus silencing the machine gun and enabling his organization to take a commanding position around the Kasba, which resulted in the complete defeat of the hostile forces.  Lieutenant Heller continued to fight aggressively throughout the day and his attitude was an inspiration to the officers and men of his organization.  While leading his men into the trenches in the Native Village later that day, Lieutenant Heller was killed by a heavy blast of machine-gun fire.  Second Lieutenant Heller's intrepid actions, personal bravery and zealous devotion to duty at the cost of his life, exemplify the highest traditions of the military forces of the United States and reflect great credit upon himself, the 9th Infantry Division, and the United States Army.\"</i>",

The US instituted a peacetime draft in 1940, and Taylor was inducted into the US Army under this draft in May 1941.  He quickly advanced in rank and received his commission as Second Lieutenant without having to attend Officer Training School.  However, he became frustrated with his duty at a POW (Prisoner of War) camp in Georgia, so he resigned his commission.  He was re-inducted into the Army as a private and sent to California for training in anti-aircraft weaponry.  After training was complete, he was sent to France in Aug 1944.  His division, the 29th, planned secret crossings from Belgium, France, and the Netherlands into Germany, and it was on one of these clandestine passages that Taylor was killed.",

He flew one of the first SBDs (Scout Bomber Douglas) Dauntless dive bombers made by Douglas Aircraft Company at their El Segundo, California factory.  Weber was stationed on the US aircraft carrier Enterprise, which was put on defensive patrol the day after Pearl Harbor was attacked (7 Dec 1941).  On the morning of 4 Jun 1942, the first day of the Battle of Midway, the Enterprise Morning Carrier Strike Group of 33 aircraft, after an extensive time and fuel consuming search, located the Japanese fleet.  The Strike Group, while not following Navy Doctrine because of battle conditions, proceeded to attack.  As a result, ENS Weber piloted one of only three SBDs to attack the Akagi - the largest carrier and Flagship of the Japanese fleet.  The three Dauntless Dive Bombers caused devastating continuous damage, rendering the carrier useless.  Weber's bomb just missed the stern of the ship, damaging its rudder and peeling back the deck.  Eventually the ship, while being towed back to Japan, had to be scuttled. ",

Defying extreme danger from concentrated anti- aircraft barrage and powerful fighter opposition, Ensign Weber, with bold determination and courageous zeal, participated in dive-bombing assaults against Japanese naval units. Flying at a distance from his own forces which rendered return unlikely because of probable fuel exhaustion, he pressed home his attacks with extreme disregard for his own personal safety, scoring a direct hit on an enemy aircraft carrier. Later, while pressing home a desperate and vigorous counterattack against enemy Japanese fighter planes, he was shot down. His gallant intrepidity and loyal devotion to duty contributed greatly to the success of our forces and were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life for his country.\"</i>",

Records indicate Captain Whaley was killed several weeks later in the attack on the Enoura Maru; however, these reports often involve information solely furnished by enemy governments, with some casualties given multiple dates of death.  Future research may determine that these reports were inaccurate.  Captain Whaley’s remains could not be identified following the war, and he is still unaccounted-for.

The bodies were piled up on the beach preparatory to disposal by mass cremation.  However, this did not occur, due to harassment by US aircraft.  The bodies were then buried in mass graves which have been recovered.  These remains are believed to be in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific (Punchbowl) in Honolulu, Hawaii.  The remains are now undergoing DNA identification procedures.  Brooke Chesney, the great-great-granddaughter of Doc's mother's sister, has added her DNA to the Family Reference Database in anticipation of providing a match to his remains.  If this happens, CPT Whaley will be interred in the Whaley family cemetery. ",

    "Remarks": "BPAA incident report, background information:  \"<i>On December 13, 1944, Japanese forces in the Philippines began the transfer of 1,621 Allied prisoners of war (POWs) to Japan.  The POWs were to make the journey aboard transport ships whose harsh conditions and extreme overcrowding led survivors to refer to them as \"Hell Ships.\"  The ships also lacked markings that would distinguish them from any other military target, causing some of them to be attacked by Allied forces who could not identify them as POW transports.  On December 14, 1944, Allied aircraft attacked the first ship, the Oryoku Maru, in Subic Bay in the Philippines, killing many Allied POWs who became lost in the water, sank with the ship, or were washed ashore.  Survivors of the bombing were put aboard two other ships, the Enoura Maru and the Brazil Maru, to continue on to Japan.  During the journey, while anchored in Takao Harbor, Formosa (present-day Taiwan), the Enoura Maru was attacked by Allied aircraft from the USS Hornet (CV-8), killing Allied POWs who were lost in the water, on board the ship, or on the nearby shore.  Survivors of the Enoura Maru bombing were loaded onto the Brazil Maru, and reached Japan on January 30, 1945.  As a result of these incidents, Allied POWs were lost in the Philippines, at sea between the Philippines and Taiwan, while anchored in Taiwan, at sea between Taiwan and Japan, and in Japan.  The attacks on these POW transports ultimately resulted in a series of death notifications from the Japanese government through the International Red Cross (IRC), and some casualties were given up to five different dates of death at various locations during the transfer.  Witness accounts from surviving POWs offer detailed information for a handful of casualties, but the specific dates of loss and/or last-known locations for many of these POWs are based on the most recent reported date of death.\"</i>",

    "Incident": "Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency: <i> “On 26 November 1971, an F-4 Phantom II (tail number 66-7752, call sign 'Owl 08') conducted a forward air control mission over a heavily wooded, mountainous jungle area in eastern Laos.  Last radio contact with the aircraft occurred as it was enroute to the target area in Savannakhet Province in the vicinity of (GC) VD 964 056.  Weather conditions were extremely poor with rain, clouds and low visibility.  When controllers could not reestablish radio contact with the crew of the Phantom, a seven day search and rescue effort began.  Continuing bad weather and rugged terrain hampered visual and photographic searches, and radio and electronic contact could not be established.  The search was unsuccessful and the crew were declared missing.  ... Beutel was weapons system operator aboard the Phantom when it disappeared, and his remains were not recovered.  Subsequent to the incident, and while carried in the status of missing in action (MIA), the US Air Force promoted 1st Lt Beutel to the rank of Captain.  Based on all information available, DPAA assessed the individual's case to be in the category of Active Pursuit.\"</i>",

When the base came under intense rocket and mortar fire the Tactical Operations Center took a direct hit, knocking out all communications with the firing elements of the Battery.  First Lieutenant Bridgman picked up a radio and moved through the impacting area to a position where he could communicate with the firing elements and adjust their fires.  He continued to adjust the artillery fires even when an enemy round impacted near-by, wounding him.  His gallant action was in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflects great credit upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army.\"</i>",

An interceptor pilot in Japan and Okinawa through 1959, he then expanded his expertise to become an air weapons controller at Luke-Williams (Arizona) AFB.  1961 found him at Ramstein (Germany) Air Base, serving as flight commander and standards/evaluation officer.  In 1965, Major Knott was re-assigned to Laredo (Texas) AFB as an instructor pilot for T-33 Shooting Star and T-38 Talon trainers, serving as both squadron and group element leader.  Then assigned to Bien Hoa (Vietnam) Air Base, he was attached to the famed First Cavalry Division of the US Army.  As a Forward Air Controller, he flew the OV-10A Bronco.  After just three months in Vietnam, Major Knott departed on his last of many hazardous combat missions, which ended tragically when he was shot down by enemy fire and perished.                                                                                </i>Heartfelt thanks to Bill Durall '72 for editing Major Knott's service history.

Major Knott, acting positively and decisively, cleared other aircraft from the pattern, coordinated crash and rescue facilities and talked the student through a successful pattern and landing.

A large enemy force launched an attack on the unit's night defensive position.  The perimeter of Private Moller's unit was penetrated by the Viet Cong and the friendly troops were forced to pull back, establishing a secondary defense.  Private Moller courageously held his position until being mortally wounded by the intense enemy fire.  His valorous actions were of immeasurable value to the successful completion of the mission and the defeat of the enemy force.  Private Moller's personal bravery and devotion to duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, the 25th Infantry Division, and the United States Army.\"</i>",
